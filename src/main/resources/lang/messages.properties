direction.h1=Directions
direction.p1=There are many types of robots; they are used in many different environments and with very different purposes, as despite differences in application and their construction, they nevertheless have common features from the point of view of their construction.
direction.li1=All robots have a mechanical structure, frame or shape, designed to achieve the specific task. For example, a robot designed to travel through heavy dirt and mud, most likely uses caterpillar tracks. The mechanical aspect is the creator's decision how to make the robot perform the assigned task on the one hand, and that how the robot copes with the peculiarities of its surrounding environment. Form follows purpose.
direction.li2=Robots have electrical components that power and control them the mechanical part. So, for example, the robot with caterpillar tracks will \
  it needs some kind of power to move the tracker circuits. \
  This energy comes in the form of electricity, which you will need to\
  travels through a wire. Even machines that draw their energy from\ \
  oil still need electricity to start the process \
  combustion, which explains why most gasoline-powered machines, such as\
  cars have a source of electricity.The electrical aspect of\
  robots is used for movement (via motors), observation (where\
  electrical signals are used to measure things like heat,\
  sound, position and energy status) and operations (robots need\
  some degree of electrical power supplied to their engines\
  and sensors to activate and perform basic operations).
direction.li3=All robots contain some level of programming code. The program code\
  determines how a robot decides when and how to do something. In the example\
  with the caterpillar track, a robot that has to go through mud\
  time, can have the correct mechanical design and get\
  the required amount of energy from your battery, but it will not be able to\
  moved without a program to determine exactly how it should move.\
  Programs are fundamental to a robot because it could\
  to have excellent mechanical and electrical construction but if\
  his program is badly made, the fulfillment of his assigned tasks will\
  be very bad (if they come true at all).There are three different types\
  robotic programs: remote control, artificial intelligence and\
  hybrid. A remote control robot has a preset\
  a set of commands that it will only work with if and when it receives them as\
  signal from the control source - the remote control\
  management.Robots that use artificial intelligence interact\
  with the environment alone (without a source of control) and can\
  determine their reactions to objects and problems they encounter,\
  using their previous programming. Hybrid is a form of\
  programming that includes both functions.
etymology.h1=Etymology
etymology.p1=The word robotics is derived from the word robot, which in turn is\
  first used by the Czech writer Karel Čapek in his play R.U.R.\
  (Czech: Rossumovi universal roboti), which was exported in 1920\
  d. The word robot comes from the Slavic word "robota" (work, labor).\
  The play begins in a factory that makes artificial people called\
  robots - creatures that can be confused with humans - a lot\
  similar to the modern idea of ​​androids. In fact, Karel is not inventing\
  the word. He wrote a short letter to the etymology of the word at Oxford\
  English Dictionary, in which he lists his brother Josef Čapek as real\
  creator of the word.
etymology.p2=According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word "robotics" is used for\
  first by Isaac Asimov in his science fiction short story "Liar!",\
  published May 1941 in Astounding Science Fiction. Asimov is not\
  knew he was coining a new term; since science and technology for\
  electrical devices is electronics, he assumed robotics\
  inherently refers to robot science and technology. Asimov\
  states that the first use of the word robotics is in his story\
  "Runaround" (Astounding Science Fiction, March 1942) However\
  the original publication of “Liar!” preceded that of “Runaround” with\
  ten months, so that the former is usually cited as the work, c\
  which lies the origin of the word.

history.h1=History
history.p=In 1942, Isaac Asimov's science fiction writer created\
  the three laws of robotics. In 1948, Norbert Wiener formulated\
  the principles of cybernetics, practically based on robotics.\
  Fully autonomous robots appeared only in the second half of the 20th century\
  century. The first digitally controlled and programmable robot - The Unimate, is\
  installed in 1961, to lift hot pieces of metal from a machine\
  for casting and accumulation. Commercial and industrial robots are widely\
  common today and used to be cheaper, more accurate and more reliable\
  doing work compared to human labor.They are also used in\
  jobs that are too dirty, dangerous or grim to be\
  suitable for humans. Robots are widely used in manufacturing,\
  assembly, packing and packaging, transport of goods, research of\
  Earth and space, surgery, weapons industry, laboratory\
  research and mass production of consumer and industrial\
  goods.

usage.h1=Usage
usage.p1=Robots are an important part of many modern manufacturing processes.\
  Factories are increasing the use of robots and the number of jobs involved\
  with robotics, growing. In the growth of job positions related to\
  robotics, steady growth is observed. The use of robots in\
  industry has led to increased productivity and efficiency\
  and has helped reduce costs. It is often considered good\
  long term investment.
usage.p2=A large part of the products produced in mass series in the modern\
  industry, consist of many smaller elements with structural,\
  functional or decorative purpose. In the category of\
  multi-component products fall into a wide assortment of objects - from\
  large-scale systems to microscopic devices, including computers,\
  electronics, automotive parts such as engines, pumps, gears,\
  steering gear etc.
usage.p3=Assembling the finished product requires a set of different\
  assembly operations which in the past were in whole or in part\
  carried out by people using the appropriate tools and machines.\
  Advances in robotics make all assembly tasks possible today\
  to be performed automatically, and the robotic lines for\
  assembly have become the "gold standard" in high-speed and\
  dynamic modern production.
